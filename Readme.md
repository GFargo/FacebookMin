# FacebookMin - Minimize the Noise 👊

One day I woke up and was tired of the [time suck](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=time+suck) characteristics about Facebook.  Instead of simply deleting my account I decided to explore the capabilities of [Google Extensions](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions).

This extension currently functions to 🔥🔥remove the "News Feed" entirely🔥🔥 when visiting Facebook.

User Notifications, Chat, Events and other _social networking_ like groups & pages have been left intact.

#### ToDo / Bugs

- [ ] Pack up extension & Release on [Chrome Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/category/extensions)
- [ ] "New Posts" notification still appears in center of screen where feed layout is when a new post appears.
- [ ] Don't be so brutal with the feed 'filter' 😐... currently just hiding the entire element.  Maybe write some javascript to parse each react component to determine its 'connection' to the user & filter out only unwanted content 🐋


Please submit any bugs or issues through Github, Thanks! 🙏
